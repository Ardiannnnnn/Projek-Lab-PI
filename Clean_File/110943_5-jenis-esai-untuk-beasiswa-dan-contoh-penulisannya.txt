dear
sir
madam
my
name
is
anindito
faaz
applying
for
msc
integrative
neuroscience
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
i
hold
a
bachelor
s
degree
in
veterinary
medicine
from
future
university
indonesia
i
am
keenly
interested
in
neuroscience
as
well
as
want
to
be
an
expert
in
it
the
field
of
neuroscience
is
strongly
related
to
my
past
experience
and
research
focus
during
my
undergraduate
study
i
tried
to
specialize
in
that
field
by
becoming
a
laboratory
assistant
in
a
microanatomy
laboratory
faculty
of
veterinary
medicine
future
university
during
my
three
years
work
in
laboratory
i
was
involved
in
our
department
s
neuroanatomy
research
entitled
brain
mapping
of
indonesian
bat
s
as
an
animal
model
for
rabies
diseases
having
experience
for
three
years
in
neuroanatomy
and
animal
model
i
have
become
more
interested
in
studying
neuroscience
to
deepen
my
skill
and
knowledge

as
i
have
a
special
personal
reason
to
study
neuroscience
at
edinburgh
my
late
mother
was
diagnosed
with
schizophrenia
and
i
understand
the
burden
of
the
family
who
has
a
schizophrenic
family
member
some
mental
illnesses
and
neurological
problems
actually
have
started
during
pregnancy
since
the
baby
is
still
in
the
womb
however
the
study
is
still
growing
and
i
would
like
to
explore
the
possibility
of
schizophrenia
developing
since
the
baby
is
in
the
womb
with
zebrafish
as
an
animal
model
by
using
zebrafish
as
an
animal
model
we
can
see
the
development
of
the
brain
under
the
microscope
without
killing
the
mother
as
its
embryo
developed
outside
the
mother
body
unfortunately
indonesia
currently
still
does
not
have
any
zebrafish
facility
research
yet
therefore
in
order
to
study
neurodegenerative
discase
using
zebrafish
as
animal
model
i
had
to
find
a
university
that
has
a
zebrafish
facility
joining
the
msc
integrative
neuroscience
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
will
give
me
a
chance
to
work
with
zebrafish
as
i
can
learn
more
about
how
to
use
zebrafish
as
an
animal
model
at
edinburgh
zebrafish
facility
i
realize
that
it
is
important
for
me
as
a
young
generation
to
support
my
nation
s
development
through
my
ability
i
need
to
give
my
best
contribution
to
my
country
and
for
the
betterment
of
the
world
in
general
the
path
that
i
have
chosen
is
being
an
expert
in
neuroscience
after
i
finish
my
postgraduate
study
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
i
am
planning
to
become
a
lecturer
at
future
university
i
would
like
to
establish
a
zebrafish
research
group
in
indonesia
and
a
zebrafish
facility
there
so
i
can
help
indonesian
scientists
to
develop
research
using
zebrafish
i
believe
my
plan
could
be
started
and
my
dream
might
come
true
by
pursuing
higher
study
in
integrative
neuroscience
master
program
at
the
university
of
edinburgh

living
with
a
family
member
who
suffers
from
parkinson
s
disease
has
opened
my
mind
that
a
tiny
alteration
in
the
nervous
system
can
change
the
whole
family
member
s
life
my
mom
was
diagnosed
with
parkinson
s
disease
when
i
was
in
junior
high
school
and
our
life
changed
drastically
overnight
neurodegenerative
diseases
such
as
alzheimer
s
disease
parkinson
s
disease
and
huntington
s
have
been
an
enormous
financial
and
emotional
burden
for
the
family
and
society
until
now
i
surely
understand
that
being
a
caretaker
of
people
who
have
neurological
problems
is
a
high
level
burden
hence
i
wish
i
can
find
a
way
to
lessen
the
burden
of
families
which
own
a
family
member
with
neurological
diseases
with
knowledge
and
research
in
biomedicine
